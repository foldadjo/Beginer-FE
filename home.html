            MARCELO FERREIRA: I think it all started back when I did [one-shot]
            DEATH OF DOCTOR STRANGE: SPIDER-MAN with Jed. That is when we worked
            together for the first time. I had just finished my run on AMAZING
            SPIDER-MAN (2018) when I got invited to do that issue, which ended
            up being a great experience. And after that I got invited by Darren
            Shan for some more Doctor Strange, an ongoing series. Only this time
            I learned that it was Clea who was taking the mantle, and the title
            would be STRANGE. I said “yes” immediately, because working with Jed
            previously was such a great experience, and the premise of STRANGE
            sounded really exciting!
